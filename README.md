# Car-Price_Predictor-Model
 The car price prediction model aims to accurately estimate the prices of used cars using a Linear Regression model. With a dataset of 5,600 car prices, this model can provide valuable insights and assist individuals in making informed decisions when buying or selling used vehicles. The Linear Regression model is a powerful tool in the field of machine learning, capable of establishing a linear relationship between the input variables (car features) and the target variable (car price). By analysing the dataset and identifying the key factors that influence car prices, the model can generate accurate predictions, helping users navigate the used car market more effectively.

Data Overview
The dataset for this project includes information on the following features:
Name: The name of the car.
Company: The manufacturer of the car.
Year: The year the car was manufactured.
Kms Driven: The total distance the car has been driven.
Fuel Type: The type of fuel the car uses.
Price: The target variable, representing the price of the car.
